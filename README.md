# :nerd_face: Welcome to my side project

Well, basically, as I'm currently unemployed, that's my main project :tada:

## What's the plan

I'd like to do a twitter-like application. I'll start by following Michael Hartl's guide (basics are good), mainly because he implements a lots of tests and I want to muscle this up :muscle:
After finishing the tutorial, I'll add the images on posts and profiles, possibility to "retweet" the posts, etc, etc. 


## What I did

```
Every time I implement something new I'll brag about it here.
```

## And what's next ?

I'd like to try a little bit of React so that's my long term goal.

Looking forward to discussing with you !

Have a nice lurking :eyes:
